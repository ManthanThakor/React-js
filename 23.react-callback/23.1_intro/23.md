# React useCallback Hook

- The React useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.

- Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.

- This allows us to isolate resource intensive functions so that they will not automatically run on every render.

- The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.

- This can improve performance.

- The useCallback and useMemo Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function. You can learn more about useMemo in the useMemo chapter.

# Problem

- One reason to use useCallback is to prevent a component from re-rendering unless its props have changed.

- In this example, you might think that the Todos component will not re-render unless the todos change:
