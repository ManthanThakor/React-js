# what is React Query
- The React Query library (now called TanStack Query) is a powerful tool for managing server state in React applications. 
- QueryClient is a core component in React Query, responsible for handling the cache, and coordinating fetching, updating, and synchronizing data.

================================================================

# Install React Query:
- First, you need to install React Query in your project:

npm install @tanstack/react-query


================================================================

# Create a Query Client:
- You need to create a QueryClient instance and provide it to your React application via the QueryClientProvider.

import React from 'react';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// Create a client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <YourComponent />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
