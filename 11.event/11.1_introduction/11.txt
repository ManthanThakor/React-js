# React Events

- Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.
- React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.

* Adding Events

- React events are written in camelCase syntax:
- onClick instead of onclick.
- React event handlers are written inside curly braces:

- onClick={shoot}  instead of onclick="shoot()".

********** <button onClick={shoot}>Take the Shot!</button> **********
